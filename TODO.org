* Date created (everywhere).
  All models could have ~date-created~ and ~date-updated~.

* Ability to set nested tags (clojure syntax?) on transactions.
  Image that we are on ~Money Owed to friends~. We now want to set tags.
  We would like to set something like this:

  - Date: 2019-01-01
  - Movements: (...)
  - Tags: (:owned-to miquel)

  And if we are recording expenses during a trip:

  - Date: ...
  - Movements: ...
  - Tags: (:trip-to Brussels)

  Now suppose, on the other hand, that we just want to mark an expense as
  "to-review", so that it should be reviewed.

  - Date: ...
  - Movements: ...
  - Tags: (to-review)

  Everytime we have a keyword (:trip-to Brussels), it means that we
  have a key-value pair tag. Everytime we have a non-keyword
  (to-review) it means we have a simple text tag.
